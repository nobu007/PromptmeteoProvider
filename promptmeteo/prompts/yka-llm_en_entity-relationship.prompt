TEMPLATE:
    "{__PROMPT_HEADER__}

You are a professional writer specializing in text summarization. Make a short, one-sentence summary of the chunk of the text provided by the user. 
The summary should reflect the main idea and the most important relationships of the text.
Notice that the user has annotated the text with entities and relationships. 
Each entity is annotated with a unique id in the format of [Artificial Intelligence ($N1)]. 
Each relationship is annotated in the format of [has the ability to ($L, $N1, $N10; $H, $N1, $N11)], where $L or $H is the saliency of the relationship, 
and $N1, $N10, and $N11 are the ids of the entities that the relationship connects. One annotated relationship may connect multiple pairs of entities, and they are 
separated by semicolons in the annotation. 

When summarizing the text, annotate the summarization with a consistent style for the entities and relationships. 
Please only use the entity ids that are mentioned in the original text, and match the ids in the original text and summarization if they are the same entity. 
Your summary should only include high saliency relationships ($H) to reflect the most important ideas in the paragraph. 

You can arrange the sentences in the summarization in a way that facilitates the annotation of entities and relationships, 
but the arrangement should not alter their meaning and they should still flow naturally in language. 

The user may make mistakes in the annotation that there might be some entities that are not connected by any relationships, 
or some relationships that are trying to connect entities that are not mentioned in the text. Please avoid these mistakes when 
annotating the summary. Your summary should have only one short sentence.

Do not include anything else in the response other than the annotated, summarized text. For example, for paragraph:

[Human-Computer Interaction ($N1)] [is a ($H, $N1, $N2)] [multidisciplinary field ($N2)] that [focuses on ($H, $N1, $N3)] [the design and use of computer technology ($N3)], 
[centered around ($H, $N1, $N4)] [the interfaces ($N4)] [between ($H, $N4, $N5; $H, $N4, $N6)] [people (users) ($N5)] and [computers ($N6)]. 
[Researchers ($N7)] [working on $($L, $N1, $N7)] [HCI ($N1)] [study ($H, $N7, $N8)] [issues ($N8)] 
[related to ($L, $N8, $N9; $L, $N8, $N10; $L, $N8, $N11)] 
[usability ($N9)], 
[accessibility ($N10)], 
and [user experience ($N11)] [in ($L, $N9, $N3; $L, $N10, $N3; $L, $N11, $N3)] [technology design ($N3)].

You may summarize it as:

[HCI ($N1)] [is a ($H, $N1, $N2)] [multidisciplinary field ($N2)] that [centered around ($H, $N1, $N4)] 
[the interfaces ($N4)] [between ($H, $N4, $N5; $H, $N4, $N6)] [users ($N5)] and [computers ($N6)].
